# iParty 2.0

After original iParty from 2020, I decided to create updated version that could be used by anyone.

Original iParty was written in Elixir ecosystem, with a little bit of JS and lots of LiveView.

This time around, I epanded my tech stack (ðŸ¤“) so I will be using React for front-end (and maybe Rust to help out Elixir ðŸ‘€)
