# iParty 2.0

After original iParty from 2020, I decided to create updated version that could be used by anyone.

Original iParty was written in Elixir ecosystem, with a little bit of JS and lots of LiveView.

This time around, I epanded my tech stack (ðŸ¤“) so I will be using React for front-end (and maybe Rust to help out Elixir ðŸ‘€)

## About

iParty is an web app that lets you play, search, an queue YouTube videos on low-spec PCs, laptops, phones, Smart TVs and other "smart devices" that support modern WEB technologies. Besides that it allows you to create rooms where people can connect multiple device and play music in sync over internet. In one word it's all about parties baby.
